Welcome to my website on Búri, my home-build 6502 computer. This page is
intended for new users and provides a historical overview of the site and the
pages.

## What is Búri and why?

Around Christmas 2014 I developed a desire to learn some digital electronics and
discover more about how computers actually work. I'm a fairly proficient
software developer but most of my work starts a) above the OS and b) from C/C++
upwards. (Although I spend the majority of my time in Python these days.) I had
only theoretical knowledge of how an OS works, how to drive hardware and
low-level programming without a standard library to help you.

I had played with an [Arduino] a bit over the past few months and though it was
all very fun but that I wanted a big, ambitious long-term project. The Búri
project is it.

Find out more on the motivations and aims of the project on the [about] page.
