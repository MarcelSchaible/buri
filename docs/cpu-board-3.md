The version 3 CPU board included an upgraded processor: the
[W65C816](http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c816s-chip.cfm). This
processor has a 24-bit address bus and extends the 8-bit A, X and Y registers of
the 6502 to 16-bit. The version 3 CPU board was designed to make full use of the
512KiB SRAM chip I'd obtained.
