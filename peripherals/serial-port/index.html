  <figcaption>Prototyping the standalone serial port adapter.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The serial port was the first peripheral I made for Búri. Indeed I first
prototyped it as <em>part</em> of Búri itself. The reason for this is that it was the
first way Búri could actually be used as a computer. Lacking a keyboard input or
a display, the serial port was the only means of interaction and allowed me to
play with Búri without having to design additional I/O circuitry.</p>

<aside>
  Búri now has an <a href="/buri//peripherals/lcd-display/">LCD
  display</a> adapter which provides an alternate form of output. There's
  still no keyboard input at the moment but I'm investigating using a 6522 VIA
  to bit-bang a PS/2 keyboard port.
</aside>

<p>The serial port was designed to be used in conjunction with a FTDI <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12731">USB to
serial module</a>. This meant it would be very easy to connect the prototype Búri
to my laptop for testing. You can see the early serial port interface present in
a picture of an early breadboard prototype for Búri.</p>

<figure>

  </a>
  <figcaption>
    An early version of the serial port (highlighted) on the first breadboard
    prototype for Búri.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This initial version connected the ACIA <s>CS1</s> line directly to <s>IO7</s>
with the practical effect of making the ACIA appear as four bytes repeated over
the entirety of I/O area 7. The current module is a little more sophisticated.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-6551-to-bris-bus">Connecting the 6551 to Búri’s bus</h2>

<p>The serial port adapter is based around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6551">6551</a> chip. This is a chip designed
explicitly to be used with the 6502 and so very little circuitry is required to
attach it to Búri’s bus.</p>

<p>The 6551 provides all the signals necessary for a full serial port
implementation. Only a handful of these signals are needed to communicate with
the FTDI module. Let’s first consider the connection of the 6551 to Búri’s bus.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/buri/img//acia-adapter.svg">
    <img src="/buri/img//acia-adapter.png" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Attaching the ACIA to Búri's bus.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the adapter, the data and control buses from the CPU are directly connected
to the corresponding lines on the 6551. A0 and A1 are used as RS0 and RS1 inputs
respectively exposing four contiguous bytes in memory as the 6551 registers.</p>

<p>The <s>IO7</s> A1, A2 and A3 lines are connected to a 74138 3-to-8 decoder chip.
This decodes eight two-byte areas covering I/O area 7. The top two ranges are
selected by a 7400 NAND gate which outputs logic high when either of the Y6 or
Y7 outputs go low. The reason for using two byte areas means that the same 74138
chip can also be used as part of the <a href="/buri//peripherals/lcd-display/">LCD display</a> peripheral.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-to-the-ftdi-module">Connecting to the FTDI module</h3>

<p>TODO.</p>

<h3 id="serial-port-module">Serial port module</h3>

<p>In order to save space on breadboards, and to make it easier to wire up the
serial port, I wired up a simple serial port module which allows the FTDI module
to be directly plugged into the 6551.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/buri/img//serial-port-module.jpg">
    <img src="/buri/img//serial-port-module.jpg" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>The current serial port adapter module.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The module itself is quite compact. I plan to add the ‘138 3-to-8 decode chip
onto the module and expose the Y[0…5] lines to allow the module to be a
generic breakout board for I/O area 7.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>We’ve arranged for the ACIA control and data registers to appear as the last
four bytes of <a href="/buri//misc/memory-map/">I/O area 7</a>. We can define some symbols in our assembly code to
make referring to the registers by name possible. If one refers to the
<a href="http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/mos_6551_acia.pdf">datasheet</a> you can see that the transmit and data register fullnesses are
indicated by bits 3 and 4 in the status register. Let’s also define a couple of
masks to keep track of that.</p>

<h3 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h3>

<p>Initialising the serial port is straightforward enough. We need only write a
couple of values to the control and command registers. Since we’re living in the
future, we can just hard-code the fastest baud rate possible. We’ll also be
using direct polling rather than interrupts for reasons of simplicity. Again,
referring to the <a href="http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/mos_6551_acia.pdf">datasheet</a>, it’s easy to find the appropriate values.</p>

<h3 id="reading-and-writing-data">Reading and writing data</h3>

<p>Reading and writing are very similar. The general procedure is to wait for the
transmit register to be full/receive register to be empty and then write to/read
from ACIA_DATA. Conveniently, the 6551 uses 1 to indicate receive register full
<em>but</em> uses 1 to indicate transmit register <em>empty</em>. Thus both routines need only
wait until the appropriate bit in the status register is 1. The <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/reference.html#BIT">BIT</a>
instruction makes this highly convenient. It takes the logical AND of the value
in A with that specified in the instruction and sets or clears the zero flag as
appropriate. We can therefore sit in a tight loop using BIT and BEQ in both the
send and receive routines.</p>

<p>The remainder of the <code>putc</code> and <code>getc</code> routines are very simple, we write A
to ACIA1_DATA or read A from it as appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="the-other-side">The other side</h2>

<p>The other side of the connection can be any computer with a USB or a serial
port. I like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/picocom/">picocom</a> as a simple serial terminal program. It also supports
sending files over XMODEM which makes it useful when combined with the <code>xrecv</code>
command in the <a href="/buri//software/os/">Búri OS</a>.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/buri/img//cool-retro-term.jpg">

  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Some interaction with the Búri OS over the serial console using
    cool-retro-term.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Running picocom and specifying the use of XMODEM as a file transfer program is
straightforward in Linux:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> picocom -b <span class="m">19200</span> /dev/ttyUSB0 -s sx</code></pre></div>

<p>This command specifies that picocom should use a baud rate of 19200, use the
<code>sx</code> program for sending files and that the serial port device is
<code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. In the rare event that you have multiple USB-to-serial
adapters plugged into your computer, you may need to increment the <code>0</code> in the
device name(!)</p>

<p>I quite like using <a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term">cool-retro-term</a> as a terminal emulator for this since it
gives me the feeling of using a true 1980s computer.</p>
