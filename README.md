# Example programs for Buri microcomputer

I am working on my own 6502-based microcomputer over at
https://github.com/rjw57/buri-6502-hardware and
https://github.com/rjw57/buri-6502-os. This respository contains some example
programs for the system.

The C code in this repo requires the version of cc65 I maintain in the ``buri``
branch of https://github.com/rjw57/cc65.
